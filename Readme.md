I'm Dalet. I'm a geek and so on and this is my wiki.

## Software

Not an engineer. Nevertheless, from time to time I like coding in [[Python]] (and [[Micropython]]). I've been also fascinated with  [[Visual Engineering]].

## Hardware

I'm starting a hardware hobby (so I think). 

- So far, I am keeping a [[Microelectronics I have]] page.
- I am also thinking of making a primitive [[Watch Project|Smart Watch]]
