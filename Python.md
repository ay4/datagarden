## TUI Frameworks

This is a laundry list. I'm planning to develop a simple TUI application and trying to identify the framework that will fit the task the most. Thus, no opinions here.

-   [pytermgui](https://github.com/bczsalba/pytermgui) and its [doc website](https://github.com/ay4/infogarden.wiki.git)
-   [pyTermTk](https://github.com/ceccopierangiolieugenio/pyTermTk) - seems powerful
-   [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) - very beautiful
-   [curtools](https://github.com/pabloniklas/cur_tools) - emulates DOS, very cool!
## Books

-   [Free Python books](https://github.com/pamoroso/free-python-books) of which I read [100 Page Python Intro](https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/) and wanted to read [Boxes](http://ralsina.gitlab.io/boxes-book/). To read boxes, though, I need to befriend Python's objective paradigm, so [a chapter](https://thepythoncodingbook.com/object-oriented-programming/) from [The Python Coding Book](https://thepythoncodingbook.com/) would be useful.
## Assorted Fascination

-   [PathLib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) is super-useful for working with files and their paths
-   [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) is parsing arguments in lieu of the standard [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html), but [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt) is even better if you can imagine
-   [Python Prompt Toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - creates something like a fish shell within python
-   [Network Zero](https://networkzero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - cool and easier sockets
-   [Art](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/art) - ASCII Art library for Python
-   [Parse](https://pypi.org/project/parse/) - simpler parser than re
## Game engines

-   [PythonArcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/index.html) - very well documented! Used it to write a couple of things in days past.
-   [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/) - one of the two 3D engines! Looks cool
-   [PursuedByBear](https://ppb.dev/) - looks nice, 2D only. Bad docs, doesn't support spritesheets.
-   [Ursina](https://www.ursinaengine.org/) - 2D+3D. Good docs
-   [Wasabi2D](https://wasabi2d.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) - based on PyGame. No spritesheets, otherwise very cool.
-   [pyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) seems shitty, but popular
-   [pyGameZero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) - fit to beginners
-   [adventurelib](https://adventurelib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - for text games, how cool is that
-   [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) - visual novels
-   [Cocos2D](http://python.cocos2d.org/index.html) - clearly not updated anymore
## Transferring data over audio

- [ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave) is a great C++ library with Python bindings
- [amodem](https://github.com/romanz/amodem) is a library written in Python
- [minimodem](http://www.whence.com/minimodem/) as I understand can speak to actual modems. It's a cli utility.
